	  <!-- "UseThemeEngineVersion" is used to specify the version of the
    UXL Launcher Theme Engine to use in case there are changes in newer
    versions of the theme engine that designers or developers don't want
    to use. Version 1.01 is the oldest version number available and anything
    smaller than that will automatically be set to 1.01 at runtime. -->
	<!-- Starting with 2.0, this is changed to be the Theme Engine Runtime Version.
  For compatibility with TE1.x, it may be a good idea to include the
  UseThemeEngineVersion node alongside the ThemeEngine RuntimeVersion node
  and attribute.
  RuntimeVersion numbers lower than 2.0 are treated as TE1.x themes, and
  the version number in the UseThemeEngineVersion node will be used instead.
  Same thing happens if the ThemeEngine RuntimeVersion attribute is missing. -->

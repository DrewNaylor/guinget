# guinget Version 0.1 Alpha Changelog
Released on 7/8/2020 (MM/DD/YYYY).

One month after guinget's second pre-alpha version, the first real alpha version is now available! Although there are few overall changes in this version, the few changes that are there make a major difference in terms of usability, including one change that makes updating the package list much faster. Please be sure to read the Readme included with this version of guinget or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/blob/master/docs/readmes/readme-v0.1-alpha.txt) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/blob/master/docs/system-requirements.md).

If you are reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Hashes

MD5 checksums/hashes are not used for guinget as they are weaker than SHA-256. [More details](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/124), though they're not as relevant to guinget:


You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main guinget EXE file by running
`Get-FileHash .\guinget.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sums listed below. HowToGeek has a nice [article on this](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/), but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

The PowerShell method can be used for all files listed below, though you'll have to switch out the filenames.

SHA-256 sum for "guinget.exe" in the archive:

## Added

- `libguinget` is now in charge of updating the package list instead of `update-manifests.bat`. Benefits:
  - Much faster package list zip file downloads
  - Much faster package list zip file extracting
  - A pretty GUI to look at while it does its thing (unfortunately, with indeterminate progress bars for now)
  - Cancel buttons in the download and extract phases if you wish to stop the update and just load the package list from what's currently in the folder that's loaded into the package list data grid view.
    - Please be aware that the cancel button is only available during the download and extract phases, and isn't available when copying. This is due to the package manifest folder being deleted before copying begins.
	- Additionally, canceling currently requires the current phase to complete before fully stopping the update.
  
## Changed

- Marking many packages at once is now almost instant as column auto-sizing is turned off while marking packages if more than 25 are selected to be marked.
  - The threshold of selected packages that determines whether we should disable column auto-sizing while marking selected packages could change in the future, and it may eventually be a setting the user can change.
  - Previously, column auto-sizing wasn't disabled, and marking an excessive number of packages would take way too long. Now the entire list can be marked in what feels like less than a second or two (even though that's not recommended), while before it would take an extremely long amount of time. It was awful, just awful.
- Instead of saying "# packages listed", we're now saying "# packages loaded" as we don't yet have a way to show the current number of visible rows. Once we do have that available, it'll be changed back so that the number of packages listed updates as the list is filtered.
- The [project roadmap](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/blob/master/docs/Project-roadmap.md) has been thinned out a bit to spread features and changes across more versions to get newer versions out faster.

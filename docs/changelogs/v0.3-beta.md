# guinget Version 0.3 Beta Changelog
Released on 6/21/2021 (MM/DD/YYYY).

Almost a year after guinget moved to alpha, it finally moves to the beta stage! This update has several performance improvements, a few new features, some bug fixes, and even some removals. A few of those changes by name are optional KDE-style fast resizing for the package list so it doesn't slow everything down, moving the cache files instead of copying them, only extracting .yaml files from the manifest zip file, a new 64-bit build of guinget (there will still be the anycpu/32-bit build available in case it works better for you), a window that makes validating manifests easier so you don't have to type commands, and much-faster package list loading (may still be slow sometimes, but usually it should be a lot faster). Some important fixes were backported to v0.2.0.3 as I wasn't sure how long v0.3 would take, but it's ready now.

> Some packages like CrystalDiskMark and LibreOffice may require administrative permissions to install, so you'll have to check the `Elevate winget with UAC` checkbox in the `Options: Apply Changes` mini-form (accessible from `Apply changes window>Options... linklabel`) before clicking `Confirm changes`. **Please do not run guinget 0.1.3 or newer as an administrator**; everything that requires running winget as an administrator that's available in guinget is covered now. Some Windows 10 installations seem to have issues with running winget elevated from a non-Administrator account, so it may be a good idea to run winget from within an Administrator account and elevate using the checkbox if necessary. If that doesn't work, then winget must be broken, or something. I've run into that issue and can't seem to fix winget, so I'm not sure if there really is a fix.

Please be sure to read the Readme included with this version of guinget or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/blob/master/docs/readmes/readme-v0.3-beta.txt) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://drew-naylor.com/guinget/system-requirements).

If you are reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Hashes

You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main guinget EXE file by running
`Get-FileHash .\guinget.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sums listed below. HowToGeek has a nice [article on this](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/), but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

The PowerShell method can be used for all files listed below, though you'll have to switch out the filenames.

SHA-256 sum for "guinget_v0.3-beta.exe", which is the 32-bit installer attached to this release:

SHA-256 sum for "guinget_v0.3-beta_x86-64.exe", which is the 64-bit installer attached to this release:
D3A6E8C28CE684643AC8B511B853DBC721BBC88162479B80368BE908B7BB99BA

SHA-256 sum for "guinget.exe" in the archive:

SHA-256 sum for "lib\libguinget.dll" in the archive:

SHA-256 sum for "update-manifests.bat" in the archive:

The rest of the libraries in the "lib" folder are from Microsoft.Data.Sqlite and I don't want to list them all:

## Added

- Nothing in this version.
  
## Fixed

- All the packages now display as expected when you scroll to the bottom before clicking the package list or moving controls around. ([issue #117](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/117))
- Packages with lowercase IDs will now be sorted properly rather than being shown after the rest of the packages. ([issue #111](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/111))
- Loading the package list isn't (usually) painfully slow anymore as the statusbar isn't being manually updated every time a row in the package list is updated. Sometimes it might still be pretty slow, though. Further optimizations in v0.3 should help a lot with this. ([part of pr #110 but manually backported](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/110))

## Changed

- The uninstaller in Add & Remove Programs/Programs and Features/Apps & features now only displays "guinget"  as the name rather than also showing the version number. This is something else that's backported from v0.3.
- YamlDotNet has been updated to version 11.2.0.
- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite has been updated to version 5.0.7.

## Removed

- `update-manifests.bat` support has been completely removed and the script was moved to the `deprecated` folder in case anyone wants to see what it was.
- Support for directly loading manifests has been completely removed.

## Deprecation notices

- Since the code to get details from winget is deprecated, it was commented out in version 0.1 alpha. This code may continue to exist in this state as an example for how to get info from winget.

# guinget -- Version 0.1 Pre-Alpha 1 -- 6/5/2020 (MM/DD/YYYY)

## Info

guinget is now ready for its first pre-release at Version 0.1 Pre-Alpha 1, and it only took about two weeks from starting the project until now! Couldn't have done it without both Microsoft's [winget/Windows Package Manager](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) and [YamlDotNet](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet). Please be sure to read the Readme included with guinget or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/blob/master/docs/readmes/readme-v0.1-prealpha1.txt ) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://drew-naylor.com/guinget/system-requirements ).

If you are reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Checksums

MD5 checksums are not used for guinget as they are weaker than SHA-256. More details, though they're not as relevant to guinget:
https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/124

You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main guinget EXE file by running
Get-FileHash .\guinget.exe -Algorithm SHA256 in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sum listed below. HowToGeek has a nice article on this:
https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/ , but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

The PowerShell method can be used for all files listed below.

Instead of a standard changelog, I'm going to list some features of guinget.

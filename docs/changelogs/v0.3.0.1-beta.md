# guinget Version 0.3 Beta Changelog
Released on 6/26/2021 (MM/DD/YYYY).

Almost a year after guinget moved to alpha, it finally moves to the beta stage! This update has several performance improvements, a few new features, some bug fixes, and even some removals. Here are few of those changes by name:
- Optional KDE-style fast resizing for the package list so it doesn't slow everything down
- Moving the cache files instead of copying them
- Only extracting .yaml files from the manifest zip file
- A window that makes validating manifests easier so you don't have to type commands
- Much-faster package list loading (may still be slow sometimes, but usually it should be a lot faster)
- Fixes involving package ID sorting and an issue where the scrollbar didn't work correctly
- The removal of both manifest-only loading and `update-manifests.bat` support

Some important fixes were backported to v0.2.0.3 as I wasn't sure how long v0.3 would take, but it's ready now.

> Some packages like CrystalDiskMark and LibreOffice may require administrative permissions to install, so you'll have to check the `Elevate winget with UAC` checkbox in the `Options: Apply Changes` mini-form (accessible from `Apply changes window>Options... linklabel`) before clicking `Confirm changes`. **Please do not run guinget 0.1.3 or newer as an administrator**; everything that requires running winget as an administrator that's available in guinget is covered now. Some Windows 10 installations seem to have issues with running winget elevated from a non-Administrator account, so it may be a good idea to run winget from within an Administrator account and elevate using the checkbox if necessary. If that doesn't work, then winget must be broken, or something. I've run into that issue and can't seem to fix winget, so I'm not sure if there really is a fix.

Please be sure to read the Readme included with this version of guinget or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/blob/master/docs/readmes/readme-v0.3-beta.txt) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://drew-naylor.com/guinget/system-requirements).

If you are reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Hashes

You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main guinget EXE file by running
`Get-FileHash .\guinget.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sums listed below. HowToGeek has a nice [article on this](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/), but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

The PowerShell method can be used for all files listed below, though you'll have to switch out the filenames.

SHA-256 sum for "guinget_v0.3-beta.exe", which is the installer attached to this release:

The rest of the libraries in the "lib" folder are from Microsoft.Data.Sqlite and I don't want to list them all:

## Added

- 

## Fixed

- 

## Changed

- The KDE-style fast resize checkbox now has a statement that "neither guinget nor Drew Naylor are associated with KDE, and KDE is (R) KDE e.V.)". This is something I just completely forgot that I should do, which is weird considering I did that for the 7-Zip and RoboCopy options currently under the `Experimental` tab.
- Licenses and legal notices have been added for all dependencies used by Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, because I realized that would be a good idea when I noticed Microsoft.Data.Sqlite was now under the MIT License. I also realized that I didn't have the license files for it and its dependencies that I'm required to include, since I just forgot even though I added the license for YamlDotNet a long time ago.
- Moved almost all About window text into Resources for easier editing.
- YamlDotNet has been updated to version 11.2.1.
- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite has been updated to version 6.0.3.

## Deprecation notices

- Since the code to get details from winget is deprecated, it was commented out in version 0.1 alpha. This code may continue to exist in this state as an example for how to get info from winget.

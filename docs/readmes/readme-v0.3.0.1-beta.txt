guinget -- Version 0.3 Beta -- 6/26/2021 (MM/DD/YYYY).

If you have any trouble, you might be able to find an answer in the documentation. It's linked at the end of this readme file. If not, you can submit a bug report at the "Report a problem" link at the end of this readme file. Your report will be labeled by the developers accordingly in a reasonable amount of time.


You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main guinget EXE file by running
Get-FileHash .\guinget.exe -Algorithm SHA256 in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sum listed below. HowToGeek has a nice article on this:
https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/ , but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

The PowerShell method can be used for all files listed below, though you'll have to switch out the filenames.

SHA-256 sum for "guinget.exe" in the archive:
FB549A86AE201AB03FE78641FCF0DD469D8286C424BAC7F1B2D3B397F45BDB2E

SHA-256 sum for "lib\libguinget.dll" in the archive:
63C8959892E2A0EC4AD0E99D9EAF082DE8AE1886E28A83E638E43DCAE30EB860

SHA-256 sum for "lib\libscrollswitchtabs.dll" in the archive:
3F2741B885A3BDD03422E0346542BF4D13384A5287FD3BAF94D05C964ABECB92

SHA-256 sum for "lib\YamlDotNet.dll" in the archive:
A52924C5065FC796B0B6E16A1FE09B34A2AAF7BAB5308BE26EE6D27AE2B127E6

The rest of the libraries in the "lib" folder are from Microsoft.Data.Sqlite and I don't want to list them all:

GENERAL NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--> Some packages like CrystalDiskMark and LibreOffice may require administrative permissions to install, so you'll have to check the "Elevate winget with UAC" checkbox in the "Apply changes" window's mini-form version of Options accessible from the "Options..." linklabel before confirming changes. Please don't run guinget itself as an administrator for versions 0.1.3 and above.

Sometimes you'll have to update winget's sources as well since winget doesn't like updating its sources while elevated from a non-administrator account, so you can use "Package list>Update winget sources", or run "winget source update".

Some installations of Windows 10 might have issues with elevating winget, so in that case you'll have to hope it automatically elevates package installers, but I've had a problem with that in the past, and I'm not entirely sure how to fix it without just making yourself an Administrator.

--> Before running guinget, please extract the entire archive to an easy-to-access location. It won't work correctly if it's temporarily extracted without its config file ("guinget.exe.config") and helper libraries (everything in the "lib" folder). You don't have to do this if you used the installer.

--> Some documentation is available in the "/docs" folder included in this archive, while all of it is available online as linked below. Please be aware that it might not be comprehensive.

--> There are brief instructions on how to use guinget available in the "HOW TO USE" section below, with more detailed ones available in the usage guide (https://drew-naylor.com/guinget/How-to-use), in "How to use guinget.html" located in the "/docs" folder, or linked from "Help>How to use guinget".

--> Make sure to read the changelog included in this archive. There may be some documentation in this file that's not actually in the /docs (and online) documentation since I have a hard time making good documentation unless I know exactly what to talk about. The changelog does have markdown so that it looks nice on GitHub, but it shouldn't be too intrusive.

--> Version 0.1.2 and newer uses .NET Framework 4.8, so you'll have to install that as described in the System Requirements section if it's not already installed on your system. Windows 10 versions 1903 and newer already have this version of the .NET Framework installed, so you don't need to do anything in that case.

--> guinget uses YamlDotNet to read package manifests, and its license is available in "LICENSE-YamlDotNet.txt"

--> Reading SQLite databases is done using Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, which falls under the Apache License 2.0.

--> Switching tab control tabs with the mouse scroll wheel is provided by libscrollswitchtabs.

--> The source code should be included in this archive in a Zip file called "source-code.zip". Visual Studio 2019 is required to open this project as it uses NuGet packages, and there were changes in the past where older Visual Studio versions can't use newer NuGet packages or something.

--> If you find any bugs, please report them at the GitHub Issues page linked at the end of this document.

--> I am not responsible for any damage using my app may cause.

KNOWN ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Selecting all packages with Ctrl+A while searching will select every package, even the ones that aren't visible. (issue #13 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/13)
- Applying changes with too many packages at once makes guinget lock up. (issue #57 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/57)
- When displaying only the latest version of a package, some of them aren't really the latest version as shown in winget. (issue #63 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/63)
- The "Action" column shrinks for a second the first time you mark a package in a session. (issue #94 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/94)
- Running CMD from guinget on 64-bit Windows causes filesystem redirection to occur, resulting in anything that has to be launched from the "real" System32 not working correctly. (issue #98 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/98)
- Shift+clicking makes it show the first-clicked item if the selection goes above the first-selected item. (issue #99 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/99)
- If the Apply changes window is too low when you open the mini-form, the mini-form will be offscreen. (issue #101 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/101)
- Installing just for your account works, but the uninstaller (using Inno Setup) doesn't seem to properly remove it for some versions of Windows 10. (issue #102 https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/102)

--------------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run guinget, your computer requires the following:

- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48
  - Click "Download .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime" under the "Runtime" header on the right near the top. Note that this is the web installer and it'll download its components after it's opened. May take a while to download.
  - This is only required for Windows versions older than Windows 10 1903, except for Windows 8.0 as it doesn't support that version.
  
- winget https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/latest
  - I personally installed from there, but there are other methods you could use instead: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli#installing-the-client
  
- Windows versions: Windows 10 version 1903 or higher recommended.
  - guinget has only been tested on Windows 10 versions 1803, 1903, 1909, and 2004. Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, and all other versions of Windows 10 are untested although they might work for everything that's not directly reliant on winget, such as installing packages.
  - As .NET Framework 4.8 doesn't appear to be compatible with Windows 8.0, guinget version 0.1.2 or newer may not work on that version of Windows.
  - winget requires Windows 10 version 1809 or greater.
  
- Architectures: x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit). May also work on Windows 10 on ARM as a 32-bit application, though that's untested.

- Hardware requirements: 
  - Minimum: At least a 1.2 GHz CPU; 1 GB of RAM or more.
  - Recommended: At least a 2.5 GHz dual-core CPU; 2 GB of RAM or more.
  - The recommended may not be enough in some cases to prevent lockups when loading the package list and details, but it should be ok. Performance improvements in guinget v0.3 should prevent most lockups related to loading the package list, though things may still be slow sometimes. Restarting guinget a few times may improve performance as that'll cause .NET Framework to compile it to machine code.
  
- Disk space:
  - 32-bit: 5 GB space free
  - 64-bit: 5 GB space free
  
- Note that you might have problems with running this on corporate computers. The ClickOnce security settings are disabled in guinget due to Visual Studio building problems, but VS2019 doesn't seem to have the setting that tends to cause issues anyway. There may also be a warning message on first start about Windows Defender SmartScreen saying it "prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk." You can click the "More info" link, then the "Run anyway" button if you want to use it, though this may not be allowed on corporate networks.

- Disk space, RAM, and CPU frequency minimum requirements are based on the .NET Framework 4.8 requirements. guinget itself is quite small, although some packages and the cache may take up more space.

HOW TO USE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A more-detailed usage guide is available in "docs/How to use guinget.html".

1. Extract this archive to a folder. There's an installer available if you want to use one, though it may be easier to run "winget install guinget", with the caveat that the version in winget may be outdated: https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/releases/latest

2. Open the file titled "guinget.exe". I recommend making a shortcut to the app on your desktop or taskbar for easy access.

3. Refresh the package list cache using the "Refresh cache" button on the toolbar, choosing "Refresh cache" from the "Package list" menu, or by pressing "Ctrl+R".

4. Wait until the package list cache has been updated and the package details have been loaded. This may take a bit.

5. Mark the packages as you wish by right-clicking or double-clicking on them and selecting what you want them to be marked as using the "Action: (action)" items ("do nothing"/ignore, install, uninstall, or upgrade). For example, to mark a package to install, double-click on it and select "Action: Install".

You can also mark packages from the "Selected packages" menu, or by opening the package's combobox/dropdown in the "Action" column (may require a few clicks). This combobox/dropdown can also be activated by moving over to it with the arrow keys and pressing "space", though sometimes I have a bit of issue with this.

Each version of a package is listed as a separate package for now. I want to have it be like Synaptic where you open a different window to choose a different version of a package.

Search:
Searching is available, so you can use the search box to make finding packages faster. If you're showing the sidebar, you can double-click or press `Enter` on the `All` item at the top of the search terms list.

You can also search for all packages containing a specific package's ID using `Search for package ID`, either from the package context menu, or from the `Selected packages` menu.

After searching, you can press `Ctrl+F` a second time to focus the package list again.

By default, searches are re-done after updating the package list, although you can turn this off from the `Options` window under `Package list>Search options...`; uncheck `Re-run search after cache update` and click `OK`.

6. Once you've marked your packages, you can apply them by opening the "Apply changes" dialog, either from the toolbar or from the "Package list" menu.

7. guinget supports batch processing, so you can just click the "Confirm changes" button when ready. If you want to process packages one at a time, either press "Enter" or double-click on each package entry in the list when you want to start processing it.

If a package didn't (for example) install the first time, you can reset its status by right-clicking on it, clicking `Reset status for selected package`, change the `Apply changes` options via the linklabel in the bottom-left corner that says, `Options...`, and check the `Elevate winget with UAC` checkbox, then try again.

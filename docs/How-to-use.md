# Marking a package

To mark a package, you can right-click on it and select `Action>Install`, open the `Package list` menu and select `Selected package>Action>Install`, open the combobox dropdown menu for the package in the `Action` column, or move the cell selection over to the `Action` column and press `spacebar` then use the arrow keys to select `Install`. This also applies to marking a package for uninstallation, or for marking a package as one you want to ignore (ignoring is `Do nothing`).

# Marking multiple packages

To mark multiple packages, either select them with the mouse (using `Shift` and `Ctrl` like you would for a list of files) or select them using `Shift` and the arrow keys. After selecting the packages you want to mark, right-click on one of the selected packages and use the `Action` menu, or use the `Package list>Selected package>Action` menu, to mark them as you wish.
